# Flask-based REST API for the artefact model

To install for local development:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test, run 

1. Run `python app.py` inside the virtual environment (this starts a development server).
2. Open `../html/index.html` in a browser and try it out.

For development you might want to use a Python client instead of a JS one.
To do this, `pip install requests` and run `python client.py`.

## How it works [üê¢üê¢‚ãØ]·µÄ

The app is built using 

- [FlaskRESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a tool to build [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful APIS using
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), which is a tool to build web applications, built on
    - [Werkzeug](https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/), which is a tool to write web servers (handling HTTP requests) using the
      - [WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface), or Web Server Gateway Interface, which is a calling convention to let web servers interact.
      
What all this means is that we'll create a tiny `app.py` that can either run a tiny server (for development) or be used by an application server such as `gunicorn`.
This application server can then be connected to proper servers (Apache, NGINX, etc.) via the WSG interface.
So when a user makes a HTTP request, it goes to the proper server, which then passes it on to our app via the WSG interface. 

The bits you need to know about to make changes to the app are FlaskRESTful and Flask.

The API itself is defined in [API.md](../API.md).

## Simulations

These are run using Myokit.
To make things fast, we compile simulations and store them to disk.
Each call to the server then loads a simulation and runs it.
