# Flask-based REST API for the artefact model

To install:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test, run 

1. Run `python app.py` inside the virtual environment (this starts a development server).
2. Open `../html/index.html` in a browser and try it out.

Alternatively (and often easier), `pip install requests` and use `app/client.py` instead of the web page.
